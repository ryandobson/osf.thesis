Reanalyzing my honors thesis data in R  

Project Overview/Checklist: 

Clean the Data 
 reorganize the data frame 
 eliminate any unnecessary variables 
 remove any participants that are not needed 
 write the new data frame to a csv 
 
Prepare the Data for Analysis 
 restructure different variables 
 turn necessary things into factors (create document and source it in before analyses)
 create composite variables 
 run alpha re liabilities
 
 
Initial Graphs/Tables  
  create box plots for necessary variables 
  get descriptive statistics for general variables 
    Learn how to output descriptives into a nice table 
  
Run Inferential Statistics Tests 
  correlation tests 
  3x2 ANOVAs for main hypothesis tests 
   With Fisher's LSD 
  t-tests for replication prediction 
  Other tests for exploratory analysis 
  
Final Graphs/Tables 
 create the final tables and graphs 
 
EXTRA 
 Create an RMarkdown file that highlights all of the descriptives/inferential statistics 
 
 
NOTE ON TABLE CREATION: 
Don't bother trying to create a table in R completely. It is almost impossible 
to get a table in the proper format. 
OPTIONALLY: Attempt to grab the data in the easiest format possible. 
Then move things around in a excel CSV document and bring it back into R to use 
the kable package to format the table nicely! 
Ideally, you want to use R to grab the data and put it into the excel document. 
Then just copy and paste and rearrange rows/columns in Excel before bringing it 
back into R. (Could potentially do all of this in R)
