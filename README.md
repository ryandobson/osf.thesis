Project Overview/Checklist: 

Clean the Data 
 reorganize the data frame 
 eliminate any unecessary variables 
 remove any participants that are not needed 
 write the new data frame to a csv 
 
Prepare the Data for Analysis 
 create composite variables 
 run alpha re liabilities
 restructure different variables 
 turn necessary things into factors 
 
Initial Graphs/Tables  
  create box plots for necessary variables 
  get descriptive statistics for general variables 
    Learn how to output descriptives into a nice table 
  
Run Inferential Statistics Tests 
  correlation tests 
  3x2 ANOVAs for main hypothesis tests 
   With Fisher's LSD 
  t-tests for replication prediction 
  Other tests for exploratory analysis 
  
Final Graphs/Tables 
 create the final tables and graphs 
 
EXTRA 
 Create an RMarkdown file that highlights all of the descriptives/inferential statistics
